## Description

This is the official repository for [Espresso Programmer][espressoprogrammer-wp-theme], an open source [WordPress][wp-org] theme. 
I [wrote][javascript-closures-java-programmers] recently that I switched from back-end programming in Java to front-end programming in JavaScript and since JavaScript goes hand in hand with html and css, the best way to learn them is to put what I know in practice. 
If you need a simple theme and if you like how this one looks on [my site][espressoprogrammer], feel free to use it on your own.
